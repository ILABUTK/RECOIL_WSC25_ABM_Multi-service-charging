\begin{abstract}
As the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicles (HFCVs) accelerates, optimizing charging infrastructure is essential for enhancing local energy market efficiency and resilience. This study introduces an intelligent multi-energy charging station, integrating solar power with a hydrogen storage system, including a hydrogen tank, electrolyzer, and fuel cell. A two-stage leader-follower game-theoretic model is developed to optimize both station capacity and dynamic pricing under st...

In the first stage, the charging station (leader) determines the optimal number of charging units and hydrogen refueling stations, balancing infrastructure investment with projected demand and grid constraints. In the second stage, the station dynamically adjusts electricity and hydrogen prices based on real-time supply, demand fluctuations, and disruptions such as natural disasters and extreme weather conditions. Vehicles (followers) respond by optimizing their charging and refueling schedules to minimi...

To capture real-world uncertainties, an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is employed to simulate heterogeneous consumer behaviors, stochastic weather-dependent PV generation, and demand variability. A series of experiments investigate:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Optimal station capacity planning under demand and supply uncertainty.
    \item Consumer price sensitivity and decision-making under different pricing scenarios.
    \item Resilience of the system to external disruptions, such as grid outages and extreme weather events.
    \item The impact of stochastic energy generation on charging station operations.
\end{enumerate}

Our findings provide actionable insights into robust infrastructure planning and dynamic pricing strategies, improving the resilience, adaptability, and sustainability of next-generation energy systems.

\section{Introduction}
The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicles (HFCVs) presents both opportunities and challenges for modern energy markets. Traditional static pricing models and fixed infrastructure planning fail to account for dynamic demand patterns, weather-dependent renewable energy generation, and potential disruptions such as natural disasters. 

This study addresses these challenges by developing a two-stage leader-follower game-theoretic model integrated with an agent-based simulation framework. The key objectives are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize the number of charging and hydrogen refueling units to balance investment cost and operational efficiency.
    \item Implement dynamic, real-time pricing strategies based on energy availability, demand fluctuations, and station congestion.
    \item Assess system resilience to supply disruptions, stochastic energy generation, and extreme weather conditions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Capacity Optimization in Energy Infrastructure}
Existing works focus on optimal placement and sizing of charging stations using deterministic models, but few incorporate demand and renewable energy uncertainties.

\subsection{Dynamic Pricing Models in Energy Markets}
Studies on real-time pricing, time-of-use (TOU) pricing, and peak-hour surcharges highlight the importance of adaptive pricing mechanisms, yet most lack a game-theoretic consumer-station interaction framework.

\subsection{Game-Theoretic Approaches for Pricing and Infrastructure}
Game theory has been applied to dynamic pricing strategies, with Stackelberg games proving effective for modeling leader-follower interactions. However, few works integrate infrastructure planning and pricing decisions.

\subsection{Agent-Based Modeling in Energy Systems}
Agent-based modeling (ABM) is widely used for simulating multi-agent interactions in energy markets, enabling detailed consumer behavior modeling under stochastic conditions.

\section{Game-Theoretic Model Formulation}
\subsection{System Architecture and Assumptions}
The charging station consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solar PV for renewable energy generation.
    \item Hydrogen storage system with electrolyzer and fuel cell.
    \item Grid connection for additional energy supply.
    \item EV and HFCV consumers with different charging and refueling behaviors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-Stage Leader-Follower Game Model}
\textbf{Stage 1: Charging Station Capacity Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decision: Optimal number of charging units and hydrogen stations.
    \item Considerations: Investment cost, projected demand, and resilience constraints.
    \item Method: Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programming (SMIP).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 2: Dynamic Pricing Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decision: Adjust electricity and hydrogen prices dynamically.
    \item Considerations: Demand response, congestion, and external disruptions.
    \item Method: Stackelberg game-theoretic equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

\section{Agent-Based Modeling Framework}
\subsection{Why Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)?}
ABM enables realistic consumer behavior modeling, incorporating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heterogeneous consumer decision-making.
    \item Stochastic energy generation and demand fluctuations.
    \item Adaptive interactions between station and consumers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation Environment: Python-based ABM (Mesa/AnyLogic).
    \item Data Inputs: Real-world electricity and hydrogen pricing, weather data.
    \item Integration with the game-theoretic model.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Weather Variability Scenario:} PV fluctuations due to cloud cover.
    \item \textbf{Disaster Scenario:} Impact of grid outages on station operation.
